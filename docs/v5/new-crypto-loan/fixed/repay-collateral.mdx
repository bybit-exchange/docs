There are limits on the repayment amount in a single transaction.
Please read this [announcement](https://announcements.bybit.com/article/crypto-loan-manual-repayment-update-bltde33509ddde5e8fd/) before repaying with collateral. <br/>
When repaying with collateral, Bybit will charge a repayment fee. The applicable fee rate is the higher of the repayment fee rates for the collateral asset and the debt asset.
You can call this endpoint: [View fee rates by asset](https://www.bybit.com/x-api/spot/api/fixed-loan/v1/coin-config) to get "reapyFee" where "pledgeEnable" = 1 for coins' repayment fee rates.
