Subscribe to the spread orderbook stream.
### Depths
Level 25 data, push frequency: **20ms**

**Topic:**<br/>
`orderbook.{depth}.{symbol}` e.g., orderbook.25.SOLUSDT_SOL/USDT

### Process snapshot/delta

To process `snapshot` and `delta` messages, please follow these rules:

Once you have subscribed successfully, you will receive a `snapshot`. The WebSocket will keep pushing `delta` messages every time the orderbook changes. If you receive a new `snapshot` message, you will have to reset your local orderbook. If there is a problem on Bybit's end, a `snapshot` will be re-sent, which is guaranteed to contain the latest data.

To apply `delta` updates:

* If you receive an amount that is `0`, delete the entry
* If you receive an amount that does not exist, insert it
* If the entry exists, you simply update the value

See working code examples of this logic in the [FAQ](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/faq#how-can-i-process-websocket-snapshot-and-delta-messages).
