**Basic concepts**

1.Request for Quotations (RFQs) - Request for Quotations, sent by the Inquiring Party to the Quoting Party. The Request for Quotations includes one or more products and quantities that the Inquiring Party wishes to trade.<br/>
2.Quotation Sheet - Quotation Sheet, the quotation for the inquiry sheet sent by the quotation party to the inquiry party.<br/>
3.Transaction A transaction occurs when the Inquirer accepts and executes the Quotation from the Offeror.<br/>

**Basic workflow**

1. The Inquirer creates a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and selects the Quoters who wish to receive the RFQ.<br/>
2. Different quoting parties send quotations in response to this inquiry.<br/>
3. The inquiry party chooses to execute the best quotation to generate the transaction. Blocktrade receives the transaction and settles it.<br/>
4. The inquiry party and the quotation party receive confirmation of transaction execution.<br/>
5. Transaction details are published on the public market data channel (excluding party information).<br/>

**Inquiry Perspective (OpenAPI)**
1. The Inquirer uses the [/v5/rfq/create-rfq](../rfq/trade/create-rfq#) to create an Inquiry. The Inquirer can query the information of the products that can be inquired through the [/v5/market/instruments-info](../market/instrument#) , and the Quoter information can be selected through the [/v5/rfq/config query](../rfq/trade/rfq-config#).<br/>
2. The Inquirer may cancel the Inquiry by [/v5/rfq/cancel-rfq](../rfq/trade/cancel-rfq#) at any time while the Inquiry is in force.<br/>
3. The quotation party, if it is one of the quotation parties selected by the inquiry party, will receive the inquiry information in the [rfq.open.rfqs](../rfq/websocket/private/inquiry#) push channel and can make the corresponding quotation.<br/>
4. Inquirer, after receiving the offer information in the [rfq.open.quotes](../rfq/websocket/private/quote#) push channel, can choose the best offer and execute it through the [/v5/rfq/execute-quote](../rfq/trade/execute-quote#).<br/>
5. Inquirers will receive confirmation of successful trade execution in the [rfq.open.trades](../rfq/websocket/private/transaction#) and [rfq.open.rfqs](../rfq/websocket/private/inquiry#) push channels.<br/>
6. Inquirers will also receive confirmation of this and other block trades [rfq.open.public.trades](../rfq/websocket/public/public-transaction#) push channel.<br/>

**From the perspective of the bidder (OpenAPI)**
1. When a new request for quotation is issued and the offer party is one of the selected offer parties, the offer party will receive this request information in the [rfq.open.rfqs](../rfq/websocket/private/inquiry#) push channel.<br/>
2. The quotation party creates a quotation and sends it via [/v5/rfq/create-quote](../rfq/trade/create-quote#) .<br/>
3. Quoters can cancel a valid quotation at will through the [/v5/rfq/cancel-quote](../rfq/trade/cancel-quote#) .<br/>
4. The inquiring party chooses to execute the optimal quotation.<br/>
5. Quoters receive status updates on their quotes via the [rfq.open.quotes](../rfq/websocket/private/quote#) push channel.<br/>
6. Quoters will receive confirmation of the successful execution of their quotations on [rfq.open.trades](../rfq/websocket/private/transaction#) and [rfq.open.quotes](../rfq/websocket/private/quote#) push channels.<br/>
7. The quoting party will also receive confirmation of this transaction and other block trades in the [rfq.open.public.trades](../rfq/websocket/public/public-transaction#) push channel.<br/>
