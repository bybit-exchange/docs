- **ADL trigger and stop conditions are based on the following three cases:**

1. **Contract PnL drawdown ADL (based on the new grouped insurance pool mechanism, see examples 1 and 2)**
   - **Trigger condition**:<br/>
     `balance` (insurance fund balance) > `adlTriggerThreshold` (trigger threshold for contract PnL drawdown ADL)<br/>
     and `pnlRatio` < `insurancePnlRatio` (PnL ratio threshold for triggering ADL)

     Where:
     - **pnlRatio**: drawdown ratio of the symbol in the last 8 hours<br/>
       Formula: `pnlRatio` = (Symbol's current PnL - Symbol's 8h max PnL) / Insurance pool's 8h max balance (`maxBalance`)<br/>
       *Note: the symbol's Current PnL and 8h Max PnL are not provided by the API*.
     - **Insurance pool 8h max balance (`maxBalance`)**: the maximum balance of the grouped insurance pool in the last 8 hours

   - **Stop condition**:
     `pnlRatio` > `adlStopRatio` (stop ratio threshold for ADL)

2. **Insurance pool equity drawdown ADL (original mechanism, see example 3)**
   - **Trigger condition**:
     `balance` (insurance fund balance) ≤ 0
   - **Stop condition**:
     `balance` (insurance fund balance) > 0

3. **Excessive margin loss of a symbol after removing it from a grouped insurance pool (can be regarded as a special case of pool equity drawdown ADL)**
   - To ensure pool safety, the risk control team may remove a symbol from its grouped pool and temporarily establish it as a new independent insurance pool.
   - **Trigger condition**:
     `balance` (insurance fund balance) ≤ 0
   - **Stop condition**:
     `balance` (insurance fund balance) > 0

:::info ADL examples: Triggered by PnL Drawdown and Insurance Pool Balance

1. **Example 1: Pool has no significant profit in the last 8 hours, then symbol loss exceeds the PnL ratio threshold (`insurancePnlRatio`), ADL will be triggered**
   - Assume symbols A, B, and C share the same pool with an initial 8h `balance` of **1M USDT**
   - A incurs a loss of **350K**
   - Calculation:
     - `pnlRatio` = -35%
     - `balance` = 1M
     - `adlTriggerThreshold` = 1 (a constant set by Bybit)
     - `insurancePnlRatio` = -0.3 (a constant set by Bybit)
   - Condition check:
     - `balance` (1M) > `adlTriggerThreshold` (1)
     - `pnlRatio` (-0.35) < `insurancePnlRatio` (-0.3)
   - → Contract PnL drawdown ADL is triggered
   - The system calculates the bankruptcy price at **-30% drawdown** so ADL closes **50K** worth of user positions to keep A's `pnlRatio` at -30%
   - **Stop condition**: ADL stops if A's `pnlRatio` > `adlStopRatio` (-0.25, a constant set by Bybit)

   **Recovery methods**:
   1. Platform injects funds into the pool and adjusts A's PnL
   2. Pool continues to take A's positions and earns maintenance margin through liquidation on the market

---

2. **Example 2: Pool has significant profit in the last 8 hours, but symbol loss exceeds the PnL ratio threshold (`insurancePnlRatio`), ADL will still be triggered**
   - Assume symbols A, B, C share the same pool, initial `balance` = **1M USDT**
   - A gains profit through liquidation, pool 8h Max Balance = **2M USDT** (A's PnL = +1M)
   - Later A incurs a loss of **600K**
   - Calculation:
     - `pnlRatio` = -30%
     - `balance` = 2M
     - `adlTriggerThreshold` = 1 (a constant set by Bybit)
     - `insurancePnlRatio` = -0.3 (a constant set by Bybit)
   - Condition check:
     - `balance` (2M) > `adlTriggerThreshold` (1)
     - `pnlRatio` (-0.30) ≤ `insurancePnlRatio` (-0.3)
   - → Contract PnL drawdown ADL is triggered
   - The system calculates the bankruptcy price at **-30% drawdown**
   - **Stop condition**: ADL stops if A's `pnlRatio` > `adlStopRatio` (-0.25, a constant set by Bybit)

   **Recovery methods**:
   1. Platform injects funds into the pool and adjusts A's PnL
   2. Pool continues to take A's positions and earns maintenance margin through liquidation on the market

---

3. **Example 3: Pool balance reaches zero which triggers ADL**
   - Assume symbols A, B, C, D share the same pool, initial `balance` = **1M USDT**
   - Although none of the `pnlRatio` values for the symbols reach -30%, the pool `balance` drops to 0
   - Condition check:
     - `balance` (0) ≤ 0
   - → Insurance pool equity ADL is triggered
   - The system redistributes bankruptcy loss across symbols based on their PnL when pool balance = 0
   - **Stop condition**: ADL stops if `balance` > 0
