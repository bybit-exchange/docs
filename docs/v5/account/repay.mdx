:::info
* If neither `coin` nor `amount` is passed in input parameter, then repay all the liabilities.
* If `coin` is passed in input parameter and `amount` is not, the coin will be repaid in full.
:::

:::note important
1. When repaying, the system will first use the spot available balance of the debt currency. If that’s not enough, the remaining amount will be repaid by converting other assets according to the [liquidation order](https://www.bybit.com/en/announcement-info/fullstock-leverage-uta/).
2. If you only want to repay using your spot balance and don't want to trigger currency convert repayment, please refer to [Manual Repay Without Asset Conversion](../account/no-convert-repay)
3. Repayment is prohibited between 04:00 and 05:30 per hour. Interest is calculated based on the BorrowAmount at 05:00 per hour.
4. System repays floating-rate liabilities first, followed by fixed-rate
5. BYUSDT will not be used for repayment.
6. MNT will temporarily not be used for repayment, and repaying MNT liabilities through convert-repay is not supported. However, you may still use [Manual Repay Without Asset Conversion](/docs/v5/account/no-convert-repay) to repay MNT using your existing balance.
7. Starting Feb 10, 2026 at 08:00 UTC, UTA Loan manual repayments will be updated to calculate coin-conversion repayment fees using the higher of the collateral or debt asset fee rate and introduce a per-transaction coin-conversion limit of USD 300,000 (Total coin-conversion amount must less than 300,000 USD equivalent) to strengthen stability and risk controls. Please refer to [UTA Loan manual repayment update](https://announcements.bybit.com/article/uta-loan-manual-repayment-update-bltbef3f1ad72a8295d/)
