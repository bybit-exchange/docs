[Get Account Info](account-info) after a while and if unifiedMarginStatus=6, then it is successfully upgraded to [UTA2.0](../acct-mode#uta-20) Pro.

:::info
You can upgrade the normal acct to unified acct without closing positions now, but please note belows:
1. Please avoid upgrading during these period:

| | |
|:----- |:-----|
|every hour | 50th minute to 5th minute of next hour |

2. Please ensure: there is no open orders when upgrade from [UTA2.0](../acct-mode#uta-20) to [UTA2.0](../acct-mode#uta-20) Pro<br/><br/>
Regaring the conditions that upgrade [UTA1.0](../acct-mode#uta-10) Pro to [UTA2.0](../acct-mode#uta-20) Pro, please ensure:
* There is no open orders regardless of order types;
* All inverse contract positions must keep consistent with the margin mode of Unified account. 
If it is Portfolio Margin mode, you either close inverse positions or switch unified account margin mode to cross 
or isolated margin mode.
* Cannot have hedge mode inverse futures positions, which is not supported in [UTA2.0](../acct-mode#uta-20)
* **Cannot have TPSL order either**

3. During the account upgrade process, the data of **Rest API/Websocket stream** may be inaccurate due to the fact that the account-related
asset data is in the processing state. It is recommended to query and use it after the upgrade is completed.
