Upgrade Unified Account

:::note important
Banned / OTC loan / Express path users cannot upgrade the account to Unified Account for now.
:::

:::info
You can upgrade the normal acct to unified acct without closing positions now, but please note belows:
1. Please avoid upgrading during these period:

| | |
|:----- |:-----|
|every hour | 50th minute to 5th minute of next hour |

2. Please ensure:
* No open order and debt in the Spot account
* No open order and hedge-mode USDT position or isolated margin USDT position in the Derivatives account
* No open order in the USDC Derivatives account
* **Cannot have TPSL order either**

3. When the `unifiedUpgradeProcess` = PROCESS, it means that the system needs asynchronous verification processing, and the upgrade
result cannot be returned in real time. You can check API [Get API Key Information](../user/apikey-info) after 3-5 minutes,
check whether the upgrade is successful according to the "uta" field in the return.

4. During the account upgrade process, the data of **Rest API/Websocket stream** may be inaccurate due to the fact that the account-related
asset data is in the processing state. It is recommended to query and use it after the upgrade is completed.
