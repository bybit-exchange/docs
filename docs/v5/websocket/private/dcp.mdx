Subscribe to the dcp stream to trigger DCP function.

For example, connection A subscribes "dcp.xxx", connection B does not and connection C subscribes "dcp.xxx".
1. If A is alive, B is dead, C is alive, then this case will not trigger DCP.
2. If A is alive, B is dead, C is dead, then this case will not trigger DCP.
3. If A is dead, B is alive, C is dead, then DCP is triggered when reach the timeWindow threshold

To sum up, for those private connections subscribing "dcp" topic are all dead, then DCP will be triggered.

**Topic:** `dcp.future`, `dcp.spot`, `dcp.option`

### Subscribe Example
```json
{
    "op": "subscribe",
    "args": [
        "dcp.future"
    ]
}
```
