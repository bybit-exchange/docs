### Process snapshot/delta

To process `snapshot` and `delta` messages, please follow these rules:

Once you have subscribed successfully, you will receive a `snapshot`. The WebSocket will keep pushing `delta` messages every time the orderbook changes. If you receive a new `snapshot` message, you will have to reset your local orderbook. If there is a problem on Bybit's end, a `snapshot` will be re-sent, which is guaranteed to contain the latest data.

To apply `delta` updates:

* If you receive an amount that is `0`, delete the entry
* If you receive an amount that does not exist, insert it
* If the entry exists, you simply update the value

See working code examples of this logic in the [FAQ](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/faq#how-can-i-process-websocket-snapshot-and-delta-messages).

:::info
- Linear, inverse, spot level 1 data: if 3 seconds have elapsed without a change in the orderbook, a `snapshot` message will be pushed again, and the field `u` will be the 
same as that in the previous message.
- **Linear, inverse, spot level 1 data has `snapshot` message only**

### Response Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Comments|
|:----- |:-----|----- |
|topic |string |Topic name |
|type |string |Data type. `snapshot`,`delta` |
|ts |number |The timestamp (ms) that the system generates the data |
|data |map |Object |
|> s |string |Symbol name |
|> b |array |Bids. For `snapshot` stream. Sorted by price in descending order  |
|>> b[0] |string |Bid price |
|>> b[1] |string |Bid size <li>The delta data has size=0, which means that all quotations for this price have been filled or cancelled</li>|
|> a |array |Asks. For `snapshot` stream. Sorted by price in ascending order  |
|>> a[0] |string |Ask price |
|>> a[1] |string |Ask size <li>The delta data has size=0, which means that all quotations for this price have been filled or cancelled</li> |
|> u |integer |Update ID<li>Occasionally, you'll receive "u"=1, which is a snapshot data due to the restart of the service. So please overwrite your local orderbook</li><li>For level 1 of linear, inverse Perps and Futures, the snapshot data will be pushed again when there is no change in 3 seconds, and the "u" will be the same as that in the previous message</li>|
|> seq |integer |Cross sequence <li>You can use this field to compare different levels orderbook data, and for the smaller seq, then it means the data is generated earlier. </li> |
|cts |number |The timestamp from the matching engine when this orderbook data is produced. It can be correlated with `T` from [public trade channel](trade#) |

### Subscribe Example

```python
from pybit.unified_trading import WebSocket
from time import sleep
ws = WebSocket(
    testnet=True,
    channel_type="linear",
)
def handle_message(message):
    print(message)
ws.orderbook_stream(
    depth=50,
    symbol="BTCUSDT",
    callback=handle_message
)
while True:
    sleep(1)
```
