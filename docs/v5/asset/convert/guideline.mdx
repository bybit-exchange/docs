## Workflow
### Step 1: [Get Convert Coin List](convert-coin-list#)
* Query the supported coin list of convert to/from in the different account types.
* The balance is also given when querying the convert from coin list.

### Step 2: [Request a Quote](apply-quote#)
* Select fromCoin, toCoin, acccountType, define the qty of fromCoin to get a quote
* There is balance pre-check at this stage.

### Step 3: [Confirm a Quote](confirm-quote#)
* Confirm your quote in the valid time slot (15 secs). Once confirmed, the system processes your transactions.
* This operation is async, so it can be failed if you have funds transferred out. Please check the transaction result by step 4.

### Step 4: [Get Convert Status](get-convert-result#)
Check the final status of the coin convert.
