:::info
How can partial funds be subject to delayed withdrawal requests?
* **On-chain deposit**: If the number of on-chain confirmations has not reached a risk-controlled level, a portion of the funds will be frozen for a period of time until they are unfrozen.
* **Buying crypto**: If there is a risk, the funds will be frozen for a certain period of time and cannot be withdrawn.
