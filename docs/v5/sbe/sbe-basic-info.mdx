:::info MMWS / Gateway only
All SBE-based feeds are described in this section are available **only** via the **Market Maker WebSocket (MMWS) / Market Maker Gateway (GW)** infrastructure.


For access and architecture details, see the official announcement: [Market Maker Gateway](https://announcements.bybit.global/article/introducing-the-market-maker-gateway-for-enhanced-api-connectivity-and-performance-bltfaba80a427cac5e5/)

From January 15, 2026, sbe connection will only be avaiable via **v5/public-sbe**
:::

This page gives a unified introduction to Bybit's **SBE-based market data** channels and how they fit into the MMWS/GW environment. Detailed, feature-specific behavior and code examples are provided in the sub-pages for:

- **BBO SBE** (Level 1, with RPI fields)
- **Level-50 SBE** (50-level order book snapshots + deltas)

## What is SBE?

Bybit uses **Simple Binary Encoding (SBE)** in accordance with the FIX/SBE 1.0 specification:

- Binary, little-endian encoding
- Fixed-width fields where possible
- Explicit **message header** + **message body** layout
- High-efficiency decoding suitable for HFT and MM strategies

Compared with JSON WebSocket feeds, SBE provides:

- Smaller payloads (up to ~30–50% reduction vs equivalent JSON data)
- Deterministic binary layouts
- Microsecond timestamp precision
- Lower CPU usage for both encoding and decoding
