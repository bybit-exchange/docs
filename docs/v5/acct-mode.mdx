title: Different Account Modes
sidebar_label: Different Account Modes
---
There are currently three account modes existing on the Bybit platform, namely classic account, unified account 1.0, and unified account 2.0.
The classic account is expected to end service before the end of 2024.

## UTA 2.0
This account mode is the ultimate version of the unified account, integrating inverse contracts, USDT perpetual, USDC perpetual, USDC delivery,
spot and options into a unified trading system. In cross margin and portifolio margin modes, margin is shared among all trades.

## UTA 1.0
Under this account mode, inverse contract transactions are in a separate trading account, and the corresponding margin currency needs to be deposited
into the "inverse derivatives account" before trading, and the margins are not shared between each other. For USDT perpetual, USDC perpetual, USDC
delivery, spot and options are all traded within the "unified account"

## Classic Account
Under this account mode, contract transactions and spot transactions are separated. Inverse contracts and USDT perpetual transactions are completed in 
the "derivatives account", and spot transactions are completed in the "spot account"
