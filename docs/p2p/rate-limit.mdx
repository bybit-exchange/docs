## IP Limit
### HTTP IP limit
You are allowed to send **600 requests within a 5-second window per IP** by default. This limit applies to all traffic directed to `api.bybit.com`, `api.bybick.com`, and local site hostnames such as `api.bybit.kz`.
If you encounter the error **"403, access too frequent"**, it indicates that your IP has exceeded the allowed request frequency. In this case, you should terminate all HTTP sessions and wait for at least 10 minutes. The ban will be lifted automatically.

We do not recommend running your application at the very edge of these limits in case abnormal network activity results
in an unexpected violation.

## API Rate Limit
The API rate limit is based on the **rolling time window per second and UID**. In other words, it is per second per UID.

The default ratelimit for read operations is 10 requests per second, and for write operations it is 5 requests per second.

Kindly keep in mind that additional ratelimits apply for different endpoints which are subject to change depending on market situation. Here is a list of currently disclosed limits:

1) A single advertisement can be modified no more than 10 times within 5 minutes
