:::info
<b>Public</b> channel do not require authentication. The following section applies to <b>private</b> channel only.
:::

<p>Apply for authentication when establishing a connection.</p>
<p>Note: if you're using <a href="https://github.com/bybit-exchange/pybit">pybit</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bybit-api">bybit-api</a>, or another high-level library, you can ignore this code - as authentication is handled for you.</p>

```json
{
    "op": "auth",
    "args": [
        "api_key",
        1662350400000, //expires; is greater than your current timestamp
        "singature"
    ]
}
```

```python
# based on: https://github.com/bybit-exchange/pybit/blob/master/pybit/_http_manager.py

import hmac
import json
import time
import websocket

api_key = ""
api_secret = ""

# Generate expires.
expires = int((time.time() + 1) * 1000)

# Generate signature.
signature = str(hmac.new(
    bytes(api_secret, "utf-8"),
    bytes(f"GET/realtime{expires}", "utf-8"), digestmod="sha256"
).hexdigest())

ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
    url=url,
    ...
)

# Authenticate with API.
ws.send(
    json.dumps({
        "op": "auth",
        "args": [api_key, expires, signature]
    })
)
```

```json
{

    "ret_msg": "",
    "conn_id": "16c79bf6-267d-4e06-a0c1-3ca4ed3a293d",
    "request": {
        "op": "auth",
        "args": [
            "OZUDHROKUZZNVZWHKN",
            "1673261297304",

    }
}
```

:::info
Example signature algorithms can be found <a href="https://github.com/bybit-exchange/api-usage-examples">here</a>.
:::

:::caution
Due to network complexity, your may get disconnected at any time. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that you receive WebSocket messages on time:
1. Keep connection alive by <a href="#t-heartbeat">sending heartbeat packet</a>
2. Reconnect as soon as possible if disconnected
:::

## IP Limits
* Do not frequently connect and disconnect the connection.
* Do not build over 500 connections in 5 minutes.

## How to Send Heartbeat Packet

> How to Send

```javascript
ws.send('{"op":"ping"}');
```

> Pong response Example

```json
// Pong example of public channel
{
    "success": true,
    "ret_msg": "pong",
    "conn_id": "13271fcb-53ed-4e80-948e-2bdbe3a6587d",
    "req_id": "",
    "op": "ping"
}
```

```json
// Pong example of private channel
{
    "success": true,
    "ret_msg": "pong",
    "conn_id": "16c79bf6-267d-4e06-a0c1-3ca4ed3a293d",
    "request": {
        "op": "ping",
        "args": null
    }
}
```

:::caution
To avoid networks or program issues, we recommend that you send the <code>ping</code> heartbeat packet every <b>20</b> seconds to maintain the WebSocket connection.

## How to Subscribe to Topics
### Understanding Websocket Filters

> How to subscribe with a filter

```json
// Subscribing level 1 orderbook
{
    "req_id": "test", // optional
    "op": "subscribe",
    "args": [
        "orderbook.1.BTCUSDT"
    ]
}
```
> Support subscribe multiple symbols and topics, separate with ','.

```json
// Example: Subscribing to the trade data for BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT
{
    "req_id": "test", // optional
    "op": "subscribe",
    "args": [
        "publicTrade.BTCUSDT",
        "publicTrade.ETHUSDT"
    ]
}
```

<p>After establishing the connection, you can subscribe to a new topic by sending a JSON request. The request formats are as follows:</p>

```json
ws.send('{"op": "subscribe", "args": ["orderbook.1.BTCUSDT","publicTrade.BTCUSDT","orderbook.1.ETHUSDT]}')
```

### Understanding Websocket Filters unsubscription

<p>After successful subscription, you can unsubscribe by sending a JSON request. The request formats are as follows:</p>

```json
ws.send('{"op": "unsubscribe", "args": ["publicTrade.BTCUSDT"]}');
```

```json
{
    "op": "unsubscribe",
    "args": [
        "publicTrade.BTCUSDT"
    ]
}
```

## Understanding Subscription Response

> Subscription Response

```json
// Subscription response of public channel
{
    "success": true,
    "ret_msg": "",
    "conn_id": "322b49ce-d6a5-494a-9019-f1d51cd541ae",
    "req_id": "",
    "op": "subscribe"
}
```

```json
// Subscription response of private channel
{
    "success": true,
    "ret_msg": "",
    "conn_id": "16c79bf6-267d-4e06-a0c1-3ca4ed3a293d",
    "request": {
        "op": "subscribe",
        "args": [
            "copyTradePosition",
            "copyTradeOrder",
            "copyTradeExecution"
        ]
    }
}
```

> Once you subscribe successfully, you'd receive result information. You can determine whether the subscription is successful based on the response.
