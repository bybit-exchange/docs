Get available wallet types for the master account or sub account

:::tip
* Master api key: you can get master account and appointed sub account available wallet types, and support up to 200 sub uid in one request.
* Sub api key: you can get its own available wallet types
:::

:::infoPRACTICE
"FUND" - If you never deposit or transfer capital into it, this wallet type will not be shown in the array, but your account indeed has this wallet.
* `["SPOT","OPTION","FUND","CONTRACT"]` : Normal account and Funding wallet was operated before
* `["SPOT","OPTION","CONTRACT"]` : Normal account and Funding wallet is never operated
* `["SPOT","UNIFIED","FUND","CONTRACT"]` : UMA account and Funding wallet was operated before. (No UMA account after we forced upgrade to UTA)
* `["SPOT","UNIFIED","CONTRACT"]` : UMA account and Funding wallet is never operated. (No UMA account after we forced upgrade to UTA)
* `["UNIFIED""FUND","CONTRACT"]` : UTA account and Funding wallet was operated before.
* `["UNIFIED","CONTRACT"]` : UTA account and Funding wallet is never operated.
