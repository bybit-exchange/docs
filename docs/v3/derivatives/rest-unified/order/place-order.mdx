- **<a href="https://www.bybit.com/en-US/help-center/bybitHC_Article?language=en_US&id=000001135">Market order</a>**: A traditional market order, which will be filled at the current optimal price. Only when the market
order selected, the price could be `null`. To protect the market order from serious slippage, Bybit will convert the market
order into a limit order with the buy order price higher than the optimal selling price, and the sell order price lower than
the optimal buying price. Both the limit price and the executed price can be queried through the user's transaction history interface.

- **Limit order**: You can set an executed price for your order. When the market price touches the price you set, the system
will fill the order for you.

- **<a href="https://www.bybit.com/en-US/help-center/bybitHC_Article?language=en_US&id=000001138">Take profit / Stop loss</a>**: You can only set TP/SL while opening positions. Once you have held
positions, the TP/SL linked when you submit active orders will not take effect. Besides, you could modify the position's TP/SL.

- **Order quantity**: The quantity of perpetual contracts you are going to buy/sell. For the order quantity, Bybit only supports positive number at present.

- **Order price**: Place a limit order, this parameter is **required**. If you don't have position, the long order price
should be higher than _10%_ of the market price and lower than 1 million. If you have position, the price should be higher than the _liquidation price_.
For the minimum unit of the price change, please refer to the priceFilter field in the instrumentInfo.

- **orderLinkId**: You can customize the active order ID. We can link this ID to the order ID in the system. Once the
active order is successfully created, we will send the unique order ID in the system to you. Then, you can use this order
ID to cancel active orders. Meanwhile, your customized order ID should be no longer than 36 characters and should be **unique**.

- Each account can hold a maximum of _500_ active orders simultaneously. This is contract-specific, so the following
situation is allowed: _The same account can hold 300 BTCUSD active orders and 280 ETHUSD active orders at the same time._
When the upper limit of orders is reached, you can still place orders with parameters of **reduceOnly** or **closeOnTrigger**.
