:::info
<b>Public</b> topics do not require authentication. The following section applies to <b>private</b> topics only.
:::


<p>Apply for authentication when establishing a connection.</p>
<p>Note: if you're using <a href="https://github.com/bybit-exchange/pybit">pybit</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bybit-api">bybit-api</a> or another high-level library, you can ignore this code - as authentication is handled for you.</p>

```json
{
    "req_id": "10001", // optional
    "op": "auth",
    "args": [
        "api_key",
        1662350400000, //expires; is greater than your current timestamp
        "singature"
    ]
}
```

```python
# based on: https://github.com/bybit-exchange/pybit/blob/master/pybit/_http_manager.py

import hmac
import json
import time
import websocket

api_key = ""
api_secret = ""

# Generate expires.
expires = int((time.time() + 1) * 1000)

# Generate signature.
signature = str(hmac.new(
    bytes(api_secret, "utf-8"),
    bytes(f"GET/realtime{expires}", "utf-8"), digestmod="sha256"
).hexdigest())

ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
    url=url,
    ...
)

# Authenticate with API.
ws.send(
    json.dumps({
        "op": "auth",
        "args": [api_key, expires, signature]
    })
)
```

:::info
Example signature algorithms can be found <a href="https://github.com/bybit-exchange/api-usage-examples">here</a>.
:::

:::caution
Due to network complexity, your may get disconnected at any time. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that you receive WebSocket messages on time:
1. Keep connection alive by <a href="#t-heartbeat">sending heartbeat packet</a>
2. Reconnect as soon as possible if disconnected
:::


## How to Send Heartbeat Packet
> How to Send

```json
// req_id is a customised id, which is optional
ws.send(JSON.stringify({"req_id": "100001", "op": "ping"}));
```

> The response sample of Pong

```json
// with req_id
{"op":"pong","args":[1661741630642],"req_id":"100001","conn_id":"706b870c"}

// without req_id
{"op":"pong","args":[1661741654529],"conn_id":"706b870c"}
```

:::caution
To avoid networks or program issues, we recommend that you send the <code>ping</code> heartbeat packet every <b>20</b> seconds to maintain the WebSocket connection.
:::

## Rate Limits
**Private channel ONLY:**
- Each API key may have a maximum of 100 private WebSocket connections. The 101st connection will be rejected.
- An IP can connect to a maximum of 50 private spot websocket connections simultaneously.

## How to Subscribe to Topics
### Understanding Websocket Filters

> How to subscribe with a filter

```json
// Subscribing to the trade data for BTCUSDT
{
    "req_id": "10001", // optional
    "op": "subscribe",
    "args": [
        "trade.BTCUSDT"
    ]
}
```

> support many symbol, separate with ','.

```json
// Example: Subscribing to the trade data for BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT
{
    "req_id": "10001", // optional
    "op": "subscribe",
    "args": [
        "trade.BTCUSDT",
        "trade.ETHUSDT"
    ]
}
```

<p>After establishing the connection, you can subscribe to a new topic by sending a JSON request. The request formats are as follows:</p>


```json
ws.send('{"req_id": "10001", "op": "subscribe", "args": ["trade.BTCUSDT", "trade.ETHUSDT", "tickers.BTCUSDT", "bookticker.BTCUSDT"]}')
```

:::caution
You can pass a maximum of <b>10</b> args in <code>args</code>
:::

### Understanding Websocket Filters unsubscription

<p>After successful subscription, you can unsubscribe by sending a JSON request. The request formats are as follows:</p>

```json
ws.send('{"req_id": "10002", "op": "unsubscribe", "args": ["trade.BTCUSDT"]}');
```

```json
// Example: unsubscribing to the trade data for BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT
{
    "req_id": "10002", // optional
    "op": "unsubscribe",
    "args": [
        "trade.BTCUSDT",
        "trade.ETHUSDT"
    ]
}
```

```json
// unsubscribe response sample
{
    "op": "unsubscribe",
    "success": true,
    "req_id": "10002",
    "ret_msg": "unsubscribe",
    "conn_id": "46f097b7"
}
```

## Understanding Subscription Response
Subscription Response

```json
{
    "op": "subscribe",
    "success": true,
    "req_id": "10001",
    "ret_msg": "subscribe",
    "conn_id": "46f097b7"
}
```

Once you subscribe successfully, you'd receive result information. You can determine whether the subscription is successful based on the response.
