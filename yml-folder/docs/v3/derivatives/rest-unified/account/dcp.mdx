## What is Disconnection Protect (DCP)?
Based on the websocket private connection and heartbeat mechanism, Bybit provides disconnection protection function. The
timing starts from the first disconnection. If the Bybit server does not receive the reconnection from the client for
more than 10 (default) seconds and resumes the heartbeat "ping", then the client is in the state of "disconnection protect",
all active **option** orders of the client will be cancelled automatically. If within 10 seconds, the client reconnects
and resumes the heartbeat "ping", the timing will be reset and restarted at the next disconnection.

## How to enable DCP
If you need to turn it on/off, you can contact your client manager for consultation and application. The default
time window is 10 seconds.

## Applicable
Effective for **options** only.
