## What is MMP?
*Market Maker Protection* (MMP) is an automated mechanism designed to protect market makers (MM) against liquidity risks
and over-exposure in the market. It prevents simultaneous trade executions on quotes provided by the MM within a short time span.
The MM can automatically pull their quotes if the number of contracts traded for an underlying asset exceeds the configured
threshold within a certain time frame. Once MMP is triggered, any pre-existing MMP orders will be **automatically canceled**,
and new orders tagged as MMP will be **rejected** for a specific duration — known as the frozen period — so that MM can
reassess the market and modify the quotes.

## How to enable MMP
Send an email to Bybit (financial.inst@bybit.com) or contact your business development (BD) manager to apply for MMP.
After processed, the default settings are as below table:
