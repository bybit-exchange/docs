:::tip
_To some extent, this endpoint is **depreciated** because now tpsl is based on order level. This API was used for position level
change before._

_However, you still can use it to set an implicit tpsl mode for a certain symbol because when you don't
pass "tpslMode" in the place order or trading stop request, system will get the tpslMode by the default setting._
:::

Adjust the take profit / stop loss mode. `Full` position or `Partial` position TP/SL.

:::note
Support USDT Perpetual, Inverse Perpetual and Inverse Future.
