Set the take profit, stop loss or trailing stop for the position.

:::tip
* Passing these parameters will create conditional orders by the system internally.
* The system will cancel these orders if the position is closed, and adjust the qty according to the size of the open position.
* Support USDT Perpetual, Inverse Perpetual, Inverse Future and USDC Perpetual. **Note:** USDC Perpetual does not have partial TP/SL mode.
:::

:::info
New version of TP/SL function supports both holding entire position TP/SL orders and holding partial position TP/SL orders.
* Full position TP/SL orders: This API can be used to modify the parameters of existing TP/SL orders.
* Partial position TP/SL orders: This API can only add partial position TP/SL orders.
:::

:::note
Under the new version of Tp/SL function, when calling this API to perform one-sided take profit or stop loss modification
on existing TP/SL orders on the holding position, it will cause the paired tp/sl orders to lose binding relationship.
This means that when calling the cancel API through the tp/sl order ID, it will only cancel the corresponding one-sided
take profit or stop loss order ID.
