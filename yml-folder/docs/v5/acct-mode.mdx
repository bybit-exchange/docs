sidebar_label: Different Account Modes
---
There are currently three account modes existing on the Bybit platform, namely classic account, unified account 1.0, and unified account 2.0.

## UTA 2.0
This account mode is the ultimate version of the unified account, integrating inverse contracts, USDT perpetual, USDC perpetual, USDC Futures,
spot and options into a unified trading system. In cross margin and portifolio margin modes, margin is shared among all trades.

## UTA 1.0
Under this account mode, inverse contract transactions are in a separate trading account, and the corresponding margin currency needs to be deposited
into the "inverse derivatives account" before trading, and the margins are not shared between each other. For USDT perpetual, USDC perpetual, USDC
Futures, spot and options are all traded within the "unified trading"

## Classic Account
Under this account mode, contract transactions and spot transactions are separated. Inverse contracts and USDT perpetual transactions are completed in 
the "derivatives account", and spot transactions are completed in the "spot account"

## Determine account mode through API
Use the key of the corresponding account to call [Get Account Info](account/account-info#), look at the field `unifiedMarginStatus`
* `1`: classic account
* `3`: uta1.0
* `4`: uta1.0 (pro version)
* `5`: uta2.0
* `6`: uta2.0 (pro version)
<br/><i>P.S. uta or uta (pro), they are the same thing, but pro has a slight performance advantage when trading via API</i>
