## Key Upgrades
### Product Lines Alignment
V5 unifies the APIs of various trading products into one, providing users the capability to trade Spot,
Derivatives and Options contracts with a single API by distinguishing transactions through different order parameters.
Consequently, there is no need to switch between multiple interfaces when building different products – regardless of
tasks such as order management or querying wallet data – as the same API can be used to request and return results.

The global dictionary in V5 is uniquely defined to avoid scenarios where different terms are used for the same purposes,
or where a single term has multiple references. This simplifies the  troubleshooting process for users.

For example, when creating an order with `POST V5/order/create`, users can specify `category=spot/linear/inverse/option` to create
multiple orders across different products.

### Enhance Capital Efficiency
V5 provides users the ability to upgrade accounts to a unified account, allowing for sharing and cross-utilization of
funds across Spot, USDT Perpetual, USDC Perpetual and Options contracts. Users are also able to offset profit and losses
across different positions, thus further enhancing capital efficiency.

### Unified Account Borrowing
API V5 supports borrowing across a unified account mode. Users can pledge multiple assets as collateral to obtain margin
for trading across different products.

_For example_: Trader Alice opens a USDT-settled BTCUSDT contract position while holding only BTC assets. If a
floating loss is incurred, a debt will be recorded and interest will be charged hourly.

### Portfolio Margin Mode
Unified Accounts now support combined margin between Inverse Perpetuals, Inverse Futures, USDT Perpetual, USDC Perpetual, USDC Futures and Options.

### API Interface Naming Standard
API V5 offers clearer path definitions for improved clarity and reduced ambiguity. The new version divides the API
path into market data, order management, position management, account management, asset management, and more modules.

> {host}/{version}/{product}/{module}<br/>
Example: api.bybit.com/v5/market/recent-trade

|Address Segment  | Description |
|:----- |-------|
|v5/market/|Candlestick, orderbook, ticker, platform transaction data, underlying financial rules, risk control rules|
|v5/order/|Order management|
|v5/position/|Position management|
|v5/account/|Single account operations only – unified funding account, rates, etc.|
|v5/asset/|Operations across multiple accounts – asset management, fund management, etc.|
|v5/spot-lever-token/|Obtain quotes from Leveraged Tokens on Spot, and to exercise purchase and redeem functions|
|v5/spot-margin-trade/|Manage Margin Trading on Spot|

### Cancellation of Orders by Settlement Currency
Users can cancel all Derivatives orders settled by the same currency with `settleCoin`.

### Addition of Insurance Fund Interface
This interface addition allows for queries of the insurance pool, which users can use to check for any insurance fund
updates on the Bybit platform.

### Readability Improvements to API Documentation
The API documentation has been revised and proofread to improve clarity and reduce confusion. Any parts of the
previous documentation that were not clear have been revised to provide better explanations.
